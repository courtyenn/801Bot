The 3D printed parts from the [Printables Project](https://www.printables.com/model/673991-801bot) are also required.

Parts should be printed in PLA except the outer part of the 2-part wheel, which should be printed in TPU or a similar material. PrusaSlicer's `Fuzzy Outer Wall` feature adds additional grip.  
Some parts will require supports, especially the Chassis.
